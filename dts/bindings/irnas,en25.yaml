description: ESMT EN25 (or compatible) SPI flash

compatible: "irnas,en25"

include: [spi-device.yaml]

properties:
  jedec-id:
    type: uint8-array
    required: true
    description: JEDEC ID as manufacturer ID (1 byte) and device ID (2 bytes).

  size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Flash capacity in bits.

  write-sector-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Write sector size (in bytes). This might be called "programmable page" or
      something similar in the datasheet.

  erase-full-block-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The size (in bytes) of a full block for erase purposes.

  erase-half-block-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The size (in bytes) of a half block for erase purposes.

  erase-sector-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The size (in bytes) of a sector for erase purposes. This size
      should be the smallest erasable sector/block/page that the chip supports.
      NOTE: This driver assumes a uniform sector architecture.

  use-udpd:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      When set, the driver will use the Ultra-Deep Power-Down command instead
      of the default Deep Power-Down one to put the chip into low power mode.

      From the driver perspective, as it does not rely on the contents of the
      SRAM buffers in the chip, the difference between the Deep and Ultra-Deep
      Power-Down modes is that the chip consumes far less power in the latter
      but needs some more time to enter this mode and to exit from it.

  enter-dpd-delay:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 0
    description: |
      Time, in nanoseconds, needed by the chip to enter the Deep Power-Down
      mode (or Ultra-Deep Power-Down mode when the "use-udpd" property is set)
      after the corresponding command is issued.

  exit-dpd-delay:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 0
    description: |
      Time, in nanoseconds, needed by the chip to exit from the Deep Power-Down
      mode (or Ultra-Deep Power-Down mode when the "use-udpd" property is set)
      after the corresponding command is issued.

  wp-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: WPn pin

  hold-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: HOLDn pin
